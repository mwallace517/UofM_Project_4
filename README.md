This is a project about a cybersecurity topic of my choosing that I then presented to my bootcamp classmates. My presentation was about RainbowCrack, a program that generates rainbow tables to be used in password cracking. The presentation includes a cover, technical background, demonstration preview, demonstration, demonstration summary, and presents ideas on how to mitigate a rainbow table attack.
